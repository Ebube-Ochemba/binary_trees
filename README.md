# C - Binary trees

> This project was all about Binary trees.

## Summary

I learnt about  binary trees; the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree, the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists, the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and what a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree means.

## Requirements

- Language: C
- Standard libraries are not allowed, **except specified**. i.e.`printf`, `puts`, etc. are not allowed.
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
- Compiler options: `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `-pedantic` `-std=gnu89`
- Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
